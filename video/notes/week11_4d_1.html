In this clip, the professor addresses the class, which is gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding a collision between a smaller car and a bigger car. The professor explains that he wanted groups to look for patterns in their data, and asks if someone found any patterns. One student speaks up and explains their group’s work and comes to the conclusion that the car with the bigger weight will have less of a change in velocity after the collision.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The discussion takes place after students have worked on the “Investigating Collisions” lab.
