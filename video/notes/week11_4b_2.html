In this clip, a small group of students are working at their desks deciding what to put on their whiteboard. The students are discussing the results of a collision between cars with lower mass and with higher mass. One student points out that the change in velocity is greater for the smaller car than for the bigger one. The students point out a relationship between the velocity lost in one car, and the velocity gained in another. The clip ends with one student saying that there’s a relationship between the transfer of velocity and the mass of the object.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The students are discussing their work on the “Investigating Collisions” lab.
