This clip involves two students and a professor working on a problem at the students’ desks. The problem involves a marble rolling down a track, off a cliff, and then into a cup. This clip is regarding only the portion of the problem when the marble is rolling down the track. The students are working on applying an appropriate model to their situation. The professor and the students arrive at the conclusion that the motion is one with changing velocity (constant acceleration).

This is from week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). Specifically, the problem that they are working on is from the “Two-Dimensional Motion Model Validation” lab.
