In this clip, a group of students are working on a problem together at their desk. They’re discussing a problem that requires them to draw a force diagram.  They spend most of the time discussing the position of different vectors and how they should break them up into components. At the end of the clip, they decide to grab a whiteboard and draw out a system schema.

This clip takes place in week 10 (Investigating Frictional Forces). The problem they are discussing is number 1 of the “A Few More Problems on Newton’s Second Law” activity worksheet.
