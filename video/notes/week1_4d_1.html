In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle for a discussion regarding position. One student is explaining how the slope of her position versus time graph, whether it’s positive or negative, determines whether the object is moving toward or away from the motion sensor. The professor takes a whiteboard to the center of the circle and asks the class to define position. The clip ends with one student giving the definition as, “The distance from the sensor.”

This clip takes place in week 1 (Constant Motion). The position versus time graphs that the students are discussing come from their work on the “Investigating Constant Motion Lab.”
