In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The students are discussing a constant acceleration problem. One student is presenting their group's finding of the displacement by using vectors, while another student talks about using the area under the velocity curve. Another student reminds everyone that acceleration is equal to the change in velocity.

This clip takes place during week 9 (Investigating Forces Part2). The students are discussing their work from the "Newton's Second Law Variations on a Theme" activity worksheet.
