In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding the modeling of a box on ramp. One student is explaining their group’s work and how they used energy physics to solve the problem. Then, using trigonometry and geometry, they were able to solve for several components. At the end of the clip, the students explain that they used one of the kinematic equations to find the acceleration of the box on the ramp.
