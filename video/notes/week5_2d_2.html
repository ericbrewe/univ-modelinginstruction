This clip involves students gathered around in a whiteboard discussion, presenting their position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs. The discussion focuses on a ball being dropped, and then bouncing on the Earth. Mainly, the discussion is about the acceleration of the ball when it’s in contact with the Earth. One student makes the claim that there is no gravitational acceleration. Several students, along with the professor, begin to discuss this acceleration of the ball when in contact with the Earth. The professor leads the class to the conclusion that the acceleration is not zero, and not constant, but that it’s changing over time.

The clip takes place in week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The students are discussing their work on the "Ball Bounce ActivityRevised” worksheet.
