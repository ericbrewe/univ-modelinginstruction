This clip involves a whiteboard session regarding constant acceleration. One student (S1) is explaining his group’s results when another student (S2) makes the correction that S1's acceleration should be negative based on his graph, while another student asks S1 to explain his group’s position graph. S1 uses the negative acceleration given in the problem to reach the conclusion that the position graph should be concave down.

This clip takes place in week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Acceleration). The problem that is being discussed is number two from the One Dimensional Motion Problem Solving worksheet.
