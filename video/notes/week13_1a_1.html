In this clip, a small group of students are discussing a problem at their desks. The discussion is regarding force versus distance graphs for a spring system. The students decide that if there are 2 springs, then it would take less force to move the same amount compared to if there were only one spring. The clip ends with the students still discussing the problems.

This clip takes place in week 13 (Investigating Spring Forces & Circular Motion). The problems that the students are discussing are from the “Investigating Spring Forces” lab.
