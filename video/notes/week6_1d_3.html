In this clip, the students are gathered around in a circle for a whiteboard discussion. Mainly, the professor is the one speaking. He explains how different groups used different methods to determine the coefficient for the kinetic energy formula. He explains how one group assumed it was ½, how one group claimed they could determine it experimentally, and how one group didn’t bother to try to figure it out.

This clip takes place during week 6 (Becoming Quantitative with Energy). The problem that the professor is discussing is one from the “Investigating Energy Conservation” which asks to derive the kinetic energy formula.
