This clip involves a group of students (at least 4) sitting at their table. The focus of their conversation is on whiteboards. When one student’s fondness for whiteboards is brought up, the student responds by saying that they help him think things out. The same student also notes that they are useful because they can be easily erased.

This clip takes place during week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Acceleration).
