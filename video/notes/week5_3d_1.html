In this clip, students are gathered in a circle for a whiteboard session. One student is explaining her group’s decision to not include gravitational potential energy on their energy pie graphs. The student says that since the book remains at a constant level above ground, that the force of gravity acting on it would be constant. The professor corrects her by saying that the gravitational energy would be constant.

This clip takes place during week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The problem that the student is discussing is problem #2 from the “Energy Pie Charts” activity worksheet.
