In this clip, a group of students are working at their desks. The professor approaches them and points out that it would be useful for them to use diagrams. The professor explains that it's a good habit to create diagrams because you use them over and over, and they help you when you're confused.

This clip takes place during week 9 (Investigating Forces Part2). The problems that the students are working on are from the "Scales in an elevator" worksheet.
