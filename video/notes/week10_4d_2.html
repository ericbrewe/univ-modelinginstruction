In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. One student presents their group’s work regarding frictional forces.  One student explains how their group used different carts made of different surfaces to test the frictional force by determining the amount of force needed to get each cart to move. The clip ends with a student explaining their group’s conclusion that the surface of the object does matter when determining friction.
