This clip involves a group of 5 students at their desk engaged in discussion with the professor regarding the derivation of the formulas for kinetic and gravitational energy. The students begin to explain their steps, stating that they used the displacement formula. The professor asks them how they are modeling the scenario, so as to be able to use the displacement formula. The clip ends without the professor getting a sufficient reply.

This clip takes place during week 6 (Becoming Quantitative with Energy). The students are working on the questions involving derivations of the kinetic and gravitational energy formulas from the “Investigating Energy Conservation” lab.
