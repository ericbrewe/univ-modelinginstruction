In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. One student is explaining their work regarding a box on a ramp. The professor asks the student to start their explanation by referring to their motion map.  The student explains that the box is accelerating. The professor notes that the motion is in a straight line in the direction of the plane.  The class then points out that this means that there’s also a net force in the direction of the plane. The clip ends with the professor stating that motion maps are helpful, and that students are given these tools because they’re useful.
