In this clip, a group of students are at their table discussing a problem with an LA. The discussion is regarding the forces acting on a box being pushed against a wall. The LA helps the students draw out the direction of the force vectors. The LA explains that the person pushing on the box is creating the contact force, and the contact force splits up into the normal and the frictional force. The LA then points out that, using trigonometry, you can figure out the problem. One student is still confused, and so the LA and the rest of the group walk her through it.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The problem being discussed is the only problem in the “Box on Wall with Angle” activity worksheet.
