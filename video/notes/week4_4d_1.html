In this clip, the students are gathered around in a circle for a whiteboard discussion while the professor is in the center. The discussion is regarding the use of vector diagrams for constant acceleration problems. One student explains his group’s work for solving the problems. The student uses the 2D motion vector equations and plugs in the values given to him in the worksheet. The student also explains how he assumed the same time for all of them to hit the ground, since acceleration due to gravity is a constant and they started at the same height.

This clip takes place in week 4 (2D Motion). The discussion is based off the students’ work on the “2D Ranking Task” homework activity.
