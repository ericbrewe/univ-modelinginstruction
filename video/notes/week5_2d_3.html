This clip involves students gathered around in a whiteboard discussion. The students are presenting their position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs. One group is presenting their work regarding a bouncing ball. They state that the energy of the ball is not lost, just transferred to the environment. The professor steps in and confirms this idea, and then elaborates on their explanation by introducing a new term, “internal energy.” The professor describes internal energy to be the energy that is lost to the environment, to sound, etc.

The clip takes place in week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The students are discussing their work from the “Ball Bounce ActivityRevised” worksheet.
