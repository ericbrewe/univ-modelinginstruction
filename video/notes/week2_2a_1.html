In this clip, the professor is working with a group of students by helping them with their lab equipment and their data analysis. The students are working on making position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs using the Logger Pro software. The professor points out that first the software creates the position versus time graph, then creates the velocity versus time graph from that data, and then the acceleration versus time graph from the velocity data. The professor mentions that therefore a small deviation in the position versus time graph will create a larger one for the acceleration versus time graph. The professor and the students note that on the acceleration versus time graph there’s a bump up and then a big drop.

This clip takes place in week 2 (Constant Acceleration). The students in this clip are working on creating the graphs in the “Investigating Constant Accel Motion” lab.
