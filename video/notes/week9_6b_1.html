In this clip, a group of 3 students are involved in a discussion with the professor at their desks. The discussion is regarding Newton's 3rd law. The professor leads the students to the conclusion that the contact forces are equal and opposite in direction. The professor also points out that these forces do not act on the same object, and therefore do not cancel out when looking at the net force on one object. The professor ends by asking the group to point this out during the whiteboard discussion.

This clip takes place during week 9 (Investigating Forces Part2). The students are working on the Newton's 3rd Law Lab: Investigating Forces Part two.
