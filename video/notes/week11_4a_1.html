In this clip, a small group of students are working at a problem at their desks. The students are carrying out their experiment of two carts colliding and notice that their graphs aren’t looking correct, so they decide to start over. The students then try to make sense of their data. The students conclude that when the collision takes place, the velocity for both carts looks the same, just shifted up and down.

This clip takes place during week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The students are working on the “Investigating Collisions” lab.
