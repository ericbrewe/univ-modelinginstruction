This clip involves a whiteboard discussion regarding constant acceleration—namely, when a ball returns to the hand it was thrown from. During the clip, one student has a question about the ball passing the point where the hand it was thrown from is located. Several students oppose her question. After a short time, the professor steps in and explains the rules of the whiteboard sessions—students must pay attention and listen when someone is talking, and that students must respect others’ questions. Afterwards, the class adheres to the rules and the session proceeds in a more orderly fashion. The whiteboards in the clip feature graphs describing the ball’s motion, as well as some constant acceleration equations.

This clip takes place in week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Accleration). The problem being discussed is number 3 from the Practice with One Dimensional Motion worksheet.
