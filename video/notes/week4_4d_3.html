In this clip, students are gathered around in a circle for a whiteboard discussion. The discussion is regarding whether or not the acceleration is constant when a ball hits the floor. The professor asks the students how to model the situation when the ball hits the floor. The students point out that before it hits it’s constantly accelerating due to gravity, but when it hits it’s accelerating due to the floor.
