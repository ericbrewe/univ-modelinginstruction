In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle while the professor is in the middle with a whiteboard of his own. The discussion is regarding the definition of “distance.” The class comes to the consensus that distance is a measure of length. The class and the professor also come to the consensus that distance is always positive and isn’t dependent on direction. At the end of the clip, the professor also mentions that students can take notes during the whiteboard sessions, but they’re better off taking them afterwards because when using whiteboards a lot of the information gets erased.

This clip takes place in week 1 (Constant Motion). The position versus time graphs that the students are discussing come from their work on the “Investigating Constant Motion Lab.”
