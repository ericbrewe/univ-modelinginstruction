In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding energy pie charts. One student is presenting their group’s work and states that since the gravitational potential energy remains the same, the respective pie chart does so too. Since the kinetic energy is increasing though, the student explains that their group represented this by increasing the size of successive kinetic energy pie charts. The professor notes that this group modeled it using constant velocity while another group modeled it as constant acceleration. At the end of the clip, the professor explains that the person adding the force is also the one adding energy, and mentions that this might be a relationship between force and energy.

This clip takes place in week 8 (Investigating Forces). The students are discussing the work they did on the pre-lab section of the “Investigating Forces” lab.
