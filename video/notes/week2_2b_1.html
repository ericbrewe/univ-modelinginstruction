In this clip, a group of students are at their desk preparing their whiteboard for the class’ upcoming whiteboard discussion. The students are discussing what they’ve learned regarding the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs. They discuss several correlations between the slopes of the graphs and decide which ones to write down and how to write them.

This clip takes place in week 2 (Constant Acceleration). The students are working on the “Investigating Constant Accel Motion” lab.
