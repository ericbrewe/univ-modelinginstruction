In this clip, a group of students are at their desk discussing a problem with an LA.  The students are discussing the forces acting on a box being pushed against a wall. The LA points out that the contact force can be decomposed into the frictional force and the normal force. When students are confused, the LA asks them to check their system schema. In order to make it clear, the students try to draw it out on a whiteboard.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The problem that the students are working on is the only problem in the “Box On Wall with Angle” activity worksheet.
