In this clip, a small group of students are at their desk involved in a discussion with an LA.  The discussion is regarding the forces acting on a box. The students agree that gravity is pulling down on the box, and that the normal force is perpendicular to the surface that it’s on. Since the box is at rest, the students know that there has to be a vertical force opposing gravity. After a lengthy discussion involving many non-physics related side-discussions, the students arrive at the conclusion that there is a frictional force opposing gravity.
