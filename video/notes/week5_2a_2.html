This clip involves the professor talking to a group of students at their desk. The professor asks the group of students about the energy of the ball bouncing. He suggests the use of pie charts to express the transfer and loss of energy. The clip ends with one student explaining to her group how to use the pie charts, and the professor saying that they should think about what the pie slices represent.
