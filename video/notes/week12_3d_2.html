In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. During this clip, only two students speak. One student states the problem and another student explains their group’s work. The student explains how first they drew a system schema, then they drew an actual diagram of what was happening, and then they drew a force diagram. Next, the student explains how they split the contact force into components.
