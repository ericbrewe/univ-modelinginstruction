This clip involves students gathered around in a whiteboard discussion. The students are presenting their position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs. One student describes his group’s work on the bouncing ball scenario. He describes the entire scenario of the ball bouncing through energy and points out where the ball loses energy to the environment. At the end of the clip, one student expresses that she has understood the scenario.
