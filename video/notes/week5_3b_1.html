In this clip, a group of 3 students are working on a whiteboard together at their desks when the professor approaches them asking them to “create some controversy.” The professor erases the group's gravitational energy pie chart from their whiteboard. One student asks how she can defend the decision to erase it during the upcoming whiteboard session. The student and the professor then discuss the reasoning behind this. The student reaches the conclusion that since it’s a constant, that erasing it just creates a “simplified version” of the energy diagrams.

This clip takes place during week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The students are working on problem #2 of the “Energy Pie Charts” activity worksheet.
