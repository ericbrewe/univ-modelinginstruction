In this clip, the students are gathered around in a circle for a whiteboard discussion. The discussion is focused on students presenting their position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs. One student presents his acceleration and velocity versus time graphs and explains that they were constants. Another student points out that when you zoomed into the graphs they weren’t smooth. The professor points to one group whose graphs weren’t smooth and asks them if that was what the motion of the car or person was doing and the class responds by saying “No.” The professor points to one group’s smooth graphs and the class agrees that they represent the observed motion better. The professor and the class then conclude that the graphs are simplified and idealized to convey the information properly.

This clip takes place in week 2 (Constant Acceleration). The discussion in this clip took place after students had worked on the “Investigating Constant Accel Motion” Lab.
