In this clip, a small group of students are working on a problem with the professor at their desks. One student explains how the spring force is equal to the slope of the force versus displacement graph, times the displacement, plus a constant. The student then explains that they took measurements for three different springs. The professor leads the student to the conclusion that the slope of the force versus displacement graph is related to how springy the spring is. The professor also leads the student to conclude that the displacement is a measure of how much the spring is compressed or stretched. At the end of the clip, the student explains that the constant would be changing.

This clip takes place during week 13 (Investigating Spring Forces & Circular Motion). The problem that is being discussed is from the “Investigating Spring Forces” lab.
