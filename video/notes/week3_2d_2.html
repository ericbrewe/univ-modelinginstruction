In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The professor is engaged in conversation with students regarding the methods used to calculate the distance traveled using a velocity versus time graph. Namely, the 2 methods are integrating the velocity versus time graph, and taking the area under the velocity curve. A bulk of the dialogue includes several students discussing which method would be easier to use and easier to explain to others. The professor concludes that the two methods yield the same thing, using either real numbers or variables.

This clip takes place in week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Acceleration). The discussion arises after students had worked on the “Constant Motion Activity” worksheet, as well as the “Constant Motion HWv1” worksheet.
