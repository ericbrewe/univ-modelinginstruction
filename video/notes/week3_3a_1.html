This clip involves a group of (at least 4) students at their desk. They are working on a problem when the professor approaches the table. The professor comments several times on them not having a whiteboard. Eventually, several students from the group get up and get a whiteboard.

This clip is from week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Acceleration). The worksheet that the students are working on is “Specific Models Using Constant Acceleration.” Specifically, they are working on Problem #2.
