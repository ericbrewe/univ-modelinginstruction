In this clip, a small group of students are working at their desk, trying to put their findings down on a whiteboard. The lab that they had worked on involved two carts colliding. One student notes that after the collision, the cart that was stopped had an increase in velocity, while the velocity for the cart that was moving would decrease. The students also write that mass somehow plays a role. The clip ends with one student generalizing their findings to say that after each crash, there was a change in velocity.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). This discussion takes place after they’ve worked on the “Investigating Collisions” lab.
