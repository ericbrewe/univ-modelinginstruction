In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle to discuss constant acceleration equations. One student (S1) is explaining her group’s results regarding displacement. When she’s finished, another student (S2) expresses his concerns regarding the average velocity formula that S1 had written on her whiteboard. S2 uses another group’s results as evidence to point out that the average velocity formula that S1 had written down was actually the formula for average acceleration. The clip concludes with S1 realizing her mistake.

This clip takes place during week 3 (Becoming Quantitative with Constant Acceleration). The problem that is being discussed comes from the Becoming Quantitative worksheet.
