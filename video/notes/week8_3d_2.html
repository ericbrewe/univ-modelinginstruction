In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding force and its relationship to energy. One student is presenting their group’s velocity versus time graphs when another student claims that the graphs don’t match the scenario. The professor asks the student to point out where they’re incorrect. The student notes that if the velocity is increasing, then the energy is increasing, and therefore a force is being added.

The clip takes place in week 8 (Investigating Forces). The discussion is based off of the students’ work on page 1 of the “Investigating Forces” lab.
