This clip involves the professor talking to a group of students at their desk. The professor asks the students to analyze their results. Namely, the focus is on the ball’s acceleration as it’s falling, when it hits the ground, and on the way back up. The professor leads the group to the conclusion that the ball is in free-fall (constant acceleration) on the way down and on the way back up. The professor brings up the acceleration during the bounce, but the students do not provide an explanation. The clip ends with the professor asking them if they can model the whole scenario.

This clip takes place in week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The students are working on the lab portion of the “Ball Bounce ActivityRevised” worksheet. They have just finished collecting data and are now analyzing their results.
