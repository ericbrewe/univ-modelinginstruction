In this clip, the class is gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The professor asks one group to present their work because he believes that their whiteboard is cleanly and neatly written. One student begins to explain their group’s work. The student states that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration, and the professor corrects it to say the net force. The student also notes that acceleration is change in velocity over change in time, and that velocity depends on directionality. The student then plugs in the numbers and gets a result. The clip ends with the professor asking the class if there are any questions.
