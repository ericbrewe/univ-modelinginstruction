In this clip, the students are gathered around in a circle for a whiteboard discussion. The discussion is involving position, velocity, and acceleration. The professor asks the students to present the rules that they’ve come up with regarding position, velocity, and acceleration. One student proposes a rule stating acceleration’s dependence on position and velocity. The professor asks the student for his evidence for proposing that rule. When the student responds by citing his experimental trials as evidence, the professor states that he wants students to be more explicit.

This clip takes place in week 2 (Constant Acceleration). The discussion in this clip took place after students had worked on the “Investigating Constant Accel Motion” Lab.
