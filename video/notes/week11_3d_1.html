In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. One student is discussing her group’s work regarding a box being pushed against a wall. The student explains how her group used the relationship between normal force and the static coefficient of friction to test whether or not this equaled the friction force. Since this was false, she explains, it led her group to use the kinetic coefficient of friction instead. At the end, the student explains that this method worked out, and fit the scenario.

This clip takes place in week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The problem being discussed is the only problem on the “Box On Wall with Angle” activity worksheet.
