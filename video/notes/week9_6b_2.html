This clip involves a group of students working on problems at their desk. The discussion they have is regarding Newton's 3rd law. They are discussing how the forces that two objects exert on each other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. They conclude that it's the same contact force, just on two different objects.

This clip takes place during week 9 (Investigating Forces Part2). The students are working on the Newton's 3rd Law Lab: Investigating Forces Part Two.
