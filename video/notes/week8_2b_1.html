In this clip, the professor is involved in a discussion with a group of students at their desks as they are working on their whiteboard. The discussion is regarding pie charts and internal energy. After the students explain their use of internal energy pie charts to describe a person pulling a cart, the professor points out that what the students are calling internal energy is actually the energy of the person pulling the cart.
