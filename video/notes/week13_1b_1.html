In this clip, a small group of students are working on a problem at their desks. The students agree to draw force versus displacement graphs. The students determine that for this problem, the force versus displacement graph is linear. The students then explain that they’ve determined the slope. The clip ends with the students deciding to write this under the “what did you learn” section of their whiteboards.

This clip takes place in week 13 (Investigating Spring Forces & Circular Motion). The students are working on the “Investigating Spring Forces” lab.
