In this clip, a group of students are working at their desks with the help of the professor. The students are working on a lab involving two carts colliding. The professor notes that it’s important to break the velocity up into components, and to record the values because the goal is to quantify things. The professor also notes that holding one cart still and moving the other can be useful. The clip ends with the students agreeing that they should re-do some trials.

This clip takes place during week 11 (Investigating Momentum). The students are working on the “Investigating Collisions” lab.
