In this clip, a small group of students are working at their desks when the professor approaches them. One student explains that the energy of the spring must be equal to the energy lost due to friction. The professor suggests writing it as the kinetic energy being equal to spring energy plus energy lost. The clip ends with the professor suggesting to start over and see if the other group members can be convinced.

This clip takes place during week 13 (Investigating Spring Forces & Circular Motion). The discussion takes place after students have worked on the “Investigating Spring Forces” lab.
