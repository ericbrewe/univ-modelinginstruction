In this clip, a group of 3 students are involved in a discussion with the professor regarding what models to use for a ball hitting the ground. They determine that the ball’s acceleration is not constant during the bounce. Therefore, using an energy pie diagram would be most suitable to model the problem. When one student points out that energy pie diagrams don’t point out the direction, the professor mentions that they should talk about that during the upcoming whiteboard session.

This clip takes place during week 5 (Predicting 2D Motion & Energy). The students are working on problem #3 from the “Questions from Ball Bounce” section of the “Ball Bounce ActivityRevised” worksheet.
