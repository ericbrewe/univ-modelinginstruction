In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding how forces are related to energy. The professor summarizes the objectives of this whiteboard discussion—to figure out how to incorporate forces into their models of kinematics and energy. One student explains their group’s work and states that forces are proportional to acceleration. The student goes into the details of how his group reached the conclusion—by looking at the changes of their velocity vs. time graph.

This clip takes place in week 8 (Investigating Forces). The discussion is based off of students’ work on the “Investigating Forces” lab.
