In this clip, a group of students are working on a lab at their desks when the professor approaches. The lab is regarding two carts colliding. The students are confused about which lines on the position and velocity versus time graphs represent which cart. To test this, the students move only one car. The professor asks the students if it’s possible for one cart to start with a positive velocity, and then turn negative, to which the students respond that it would then be changing direction. The clip ends with the students deciding to add a lot of weight to the cars to see what happens.
