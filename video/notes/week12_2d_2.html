In this clip, the professor is involved in a discussion with students as they are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is mainly involving conservation of momentum. One student presents his group’s work and reveals that his results showed that the momentum of a tennis ball hitting a tennis racket was not conserved. Another student responds by saying that momentum of the system is conserved because the ball’s momentum could have been transferred to the racket and it’s different parts. The clip concludes with the professor stating that both students are correct.
