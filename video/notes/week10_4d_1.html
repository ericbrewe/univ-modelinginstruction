In this clip, students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. One student is discussing their group’s experimental setup of how they acquired data for their lab. They explain how they attached a force sensor to a cart and applied forces at different angles. The professor asks the students if they applied the same force each time. The students respond by saying that they pulled the string slightly until the cart started to move.

This clip takes place in week 10 (Investigating Frictional Forces). The discussion is taking place after the students have worked on the “Investigating Frictional Forces” lab.
