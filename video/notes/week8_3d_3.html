In this clip, the students are gathered around in a whiteboard circle. The discussion is regarding the relationship between energy (kinetic energy) and force. The professor prompts students to speak and when they do, they reach the conclusion that energy can’t be negative, and that it’s independent of direction. The professor and the class also reach the conclusion that force depends on changing velocity. The professor also points out that a force does not only have to increase energy, it can also decrease it. The clip ends with the professor explaining that these results are consistent with the students’ rule that force is proportional to acceleration, and that this is related to energy changes.

This clip takes place in week 8 (Investigating Forces). This discussion takes place after students have been working on the “Investigating Forces” lab.
