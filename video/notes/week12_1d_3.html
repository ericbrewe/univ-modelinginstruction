In this clip, the professor is discussing the exam format with the class while they remain seated at their desks.  One student asks what happens when you think the correct answer is different from what the rest of the group thinks. The professor explains that one of the principles of good assessment practice is to assess the same way that you teach. Therefore, since they work in groups a lot, they should be assessed as groups. The professor explains that students should be used to listening to other students’ perspectives and used to arguing their point of view. At the end of the clip, the professor points out that people who are right are often pretty good at arguing why they’re right.
