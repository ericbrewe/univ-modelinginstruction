<p class=MsoNormal>In Modeling Instruction, whiteboards serve as a tool for the
communication of ideas within both small and large group interactions, as well
as student-instructor or group-instructor interactions. All groups have access
to personal whiteboards, about 2’ by 3’ in size, to use while completing their
work.  Whiteboards of this large size, as opposed to notebook-sized
whiteboards, allow for all members of the group to participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The instructor assigns each group of students to complete a
whiteboard with their model and then bring it to present at the whiteboard
meeting. Within these meetings, whiteboards serve to facilitate and mediate the
discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We feel that by using an easily erasable surface it allows
for students to feel comfortable with changing or revising their thoughts or
ideas. Although temporary, the use of whiteboards also has the students
committed to ideas, which are then presented to the class for evaluation. These
evaluations are low-pressure for the students because it removes them from
having to solve the problem in front of the class, and because their answers
can always be edited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also feel that whiteboards allow the instructor an open
door into the minds of students by allowing their building of conceptual models
to be seen. Also, the whiteboards serve as a source for interaction between the
instructor and students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the other benefits of whiteboards is that they always
work and are relatively cheap.</p>
