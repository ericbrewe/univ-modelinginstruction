<p class=MsoNormal><b>White Board Meetings</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In modeling instruction students perform labs, problems, or
assignments in small groups of 3.  The small groups are asked to “whiteboard”
answers to “the 3 questions”, models, or solutions as dictated by the
Instructors Guide. Once the students have created their own whiteboard in their
small groups the students are then given the opportunity to present their work
and discuss their findings with the other members of the class in a white board
meeting. Being that this experience is not common practice in science
classrooms, whiteboard meetings are understandably difficult for students to
warm up to. Creating an environment that supports open and productive discourse
requires consistency and explicit rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Creating a circle</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White board meetings require the students to create a circle
so that every student is able to see every other student and every other
groups’ whiteboards. The Students bring their chairs and sit by their group
members displaying their white board or boards for everyone else to see.  It is
the instructor’s responsibility to announce to the students that the meeting is
to begin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Discourse Management</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The importance of the white board meeting is in the
opportunity for the students to discuss their results or answers using evidence
to develop a consensus on definitions, procedures, concepts, and rules.  Your
role as instructor in this process is very important but instructor independent
as you grow accustomed and seek to move from an instructor-centered classroom
to a student-centered classroom.  The goal is to move toward a large group
meeting where students generate and take ownership of the discussion. However,
starting out and in specific circumstances depending on the material, there are
no rules limiting your participation. Modeling Discourse Management describes
the tools by which you influence the student discourse in the white board
meeting as well as in the classroom as a whole.</p>
